"""
    This section is meant to provide a system for creating text-based human readable backup of models
    
    However, the code is somewhat messy and it's speed doesn't scale well
    
    I have ideas to make it a lot better, but won't have the time to implement for quite a while.
    Therefore, untill I rewrite it, I'm not going to support it.
